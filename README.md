# Cake Php 2.x - Notes


New Project setup files like database.php , core.php , .gitignore and etc files example just copy and paste while creating new Cake 2.x project.


# Cake PHP .gitignore

A **.gitignore** file to be used for Cake PHP while intializing a new project.

## More Information

Some files in a Cake PHP project should not be checked into a Git version control repository. You can tell git to ignore certain files by creating a file called **.gitignore** in the top level of your working directory.

While intializing a new repository, you can intialize the new repo with a **.gitignore** file . Here you'll find an example of a *.gitignore* file that designates additional files that may be part of a typical project.

## Using the Gitignore File

Copy the example file **gitignore.example** to the top level of your working directory and rename it *.gitignore*.

Note that git will not ignore a file that was already tracked before a rule was added to this file to ignore it. In such a case the file must be un-tracked, usually with `git rm --cached filename`.
