Zaakpay provides an SDK for PHP, but we modified the SDK & created our own component for the same.

Component : This is another component that is get used for ZaakPay payment gateway.

For using this component please follow following steps,

Create a ZaakPay.php inside app/Controller/Component/
Copy paste the below code in this file
Create a controller payments.php
Create views

</div> Post data for request creation : Above action get submitted to the Purchases controller & then zaak pay component creates a request format & post the data inside form to the payment gateway.

Action : zaak_pay_post_data()

<div class="hero-unit"> <h2>Payment Process </h2>

<div>
   <h3>Please wait we are redirecting you to the payment gateway.....</h3>
</div>

<form action="https://api.zaakpay.com/transact" method="post" id="paymentForm">
   <?php

</form>

</div>

<script type="text/javascript"> $(document).ready(function () { $("#paymentForm").submit(); }); </script>

Now User get redirected to the zaakpay site for payment, user completes the payment & then get returned to the action that is set inside the zaakpay control panel.

Action : zaakpay_response()

This is the flow of successful transaction. We are yet to handle the errors & display them to the page.
This is a basic integration, you can modify this as per your need.
